# Solving Python Installation Issues on macOS to Start Building AI Products

Recently, I've been really interested in studying AI and building my first AI product.

To do that, I need to learn some Python.

At first, I tried to install Python on my Mac Mini M4, but it didn't work as I expected.

I searched online and found that the issue was related to the Python version.

There is already a version of Python installed on my Mac Mini, but I need to use the `python3` or `pip3` command in the terminal.

However, when I ran some commands, they still didnâ€™t work.

So I searched for more information online and found that I needed to change the Python version using `pyenv`.

Here is some information that might be useful:

- [On macOS 14, pip install throws error: externally-managed-environment](https://discuss.python.org/t/on-macos-14-pip-install-throws-error-externally-managed-environment/50352)  
- [Change Python version](https://cloud.tencent.com/developer/article/2049999)

I also asked ChatGPT for help with some of these questions, which was really helpful.
