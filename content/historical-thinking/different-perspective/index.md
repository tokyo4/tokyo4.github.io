### The more I think about it, the more I realize that the history in everyone's mind is essentially a "view of history."

At its core, it’s just a matter of perspective.

However, that doesn't stop some bad actors from falsifying history in order to maintain their power.

I have read so much history since I was young, but looking back, it’s all been from a relatively one-sided perspective.

In recent years, after being exposed to various different ideas, I've begun to develop some other ways of thinking. Overall, it's been quite enlightening.

Let me briefly outline the history related to Asia from World War II to the present.

Before World War II, Asia, aside from Qing China and Japan, was mostly composed of colonies or underdeveloped regions. Southeast Asia, in particular, was almost entirely a collection of Western colonies, a backyard for white people.
Japan is an interesting case. As the fastest-developing country in Asia, it was like Britain in Europe or the U.S. in the Americas.
As Japan rose, it defeated the Russian Empire and gradually strengthened its position in Asia, eventually gaining a favorable position to compete with Western countries for influence in the region.
The Qing Empire, on the other hand, was large and diverse, maintaining only loose control and struggling to manage internal and external threats. With its landlocked nature, surrounded by enemies, especially Russia to the north, it could only maintain a fragile stability.
Japan realized that no matter how strong it became, it would always be denied the resources and influence it deserved when competing with the Western powers for dominance in Asia.
Moreover, due to the Japanese being rather compliant and not aggressive enough at times, they found themselves in a position where they were constantly being oppressed by the Western powers.
The Qing Empire, however, thought highly of itself but was ultimately not as powerful as it perceived itself to be, and thus struggled with internal conflicts.
After Japan defeated the Qing Empire in the First Sino-Japanese War, it became the de facto leader of Asia.
At that point, Western powers’ oppression in Asia had pushed Japan to the breaking point, and the country began its reactionary push back.
Japan’s actions during this period cannot be judged simply as right or wrong. From the perspective of the Asian "yellow" race, Japan's decision to break ties with the West and fight for dominance against white powers might have been a necessary and valid choice.
However, from the outcome, Japan made several grave mistakes, and their choices were far from wise.
Ultimately, Japan started the Greater East Asia War, fighting against the Western colonial powers, the white-controlled colonies, and Chiang Kai-shek's regime, a puppet of the Soviet Union. The war escalated to the point where Japan fought the United States and was ultimately defeated.
With the defeat of Japan, World War II in Asia ended, but the nearly complete dismantling of Western colonies in the region was significant. From this perspective, Japan's efforts to lead the "yellow race" in resisting the West weren’t entirely without value. Southeast Asia, after all, was largely bound to Japan's cause.
From the viewpoint of Asians, the Chinese (represented by Chiang) were not noble figures in this struggle; they were like traitors who sided with the Soviets, betraying their own kind.
Thus, the establishment of China, in some ways, represented a victory for the Soviet Union and a defeat for the "yellow" race of Asia.
Chiang's forces might have defeated Japan on the surface, but soon found themselves in a losing position, unable to regain control.
However, from the geographical perspective of the Qing Empire, Chiang’s faction did manage to retain most of the empire's territory until today, which can be seen as a success in that sense.
This highlights the difference in perspectives. From the viewpoint of the Qing Empire's successors, this is an undeniable victory, yet from the standpoint of the "yellow" race of Asia seeking freedom, it’s a shameful betrayal.
There are other perspectives to consider, but I won’t go into them here.
The Cold War begins.
The Soviet Union, ironically, became the biggest victor in Asia, spreading communism across much of East and Southeast Asia.
However, Japan’s military efforts were not in vain. The Southeast Asians, who had been subjected to Western powers, were no longer willing to let the Soviet powers or their proxies control them, as seen in the resistance from countries like Indonesia.
Additionally, China, at least on the surface, gradually distanced itself from Soviet control and eventually betrayed the USSR.
The Cold War ended with the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
Afterward, we entered the era of rapid globalization.
And now, we face the onset of a new Cold War.
From Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, we can observe that some underlying issues persist.
China continues to side with Russia, the successor of the Soviet Union, which shows that China remains unable to escape its status as a country established by foreign invaders, whether through the Mongols, the Qing Empire, or Soviet-trained communist agents. It has never been a native, self-evolved ruling power. This means that China, as a geographical entity, can never truly escape the colonial legacy.
And since China remains a Soviet-KGB legacy, this system cannot assume the role Japan once did – that of the leader of the "yellow" race in Asia and the proponent of pan-Asianism.
Therefore, any talk in the Chinese-speaking community about East Asia uniting against external powers is unrealistic because, for East Asia, China is fundamentally an outsider, not an indigenous force.
Japan and Korea, being island nations, have been more likely to preserve indigenous, self-evolved factors, as seen in their tourism industries, which still carry a strong Asian flavor.
Many buildings in China are likely disliked by Chinese people themselves because they were designed according to Soviet tastes or modified after being influenced by Soviet aesthetics. They do not represent true Asian culture.
If we understand China as a colonial system similar to the Mongols or Qing Empire, and a Soviet-influenced colonial system at that, then everything that has happened in China can be reasonably explained – such as the low birth rate, housing problems, and the growing wealth gap.
China's biggest problems today are: 1) how long this colonial system can sustain itself without the financial aid from the U.S.; and 2) the issue of a shrinking younger population.
